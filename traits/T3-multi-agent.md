# T3 - multi-agent

## Definition

A system is **multi-agent** when two or more independent actors - agents, people, or both - coordinate over shared state, so that one actor's output becomes another's input.

---

## Test

Does work cross from one independent actor to another, inside the system?\
If yes, it is multi-agent.\
One actor using several tools is not multi-agent; the tools are not independent actors.

---

## Boundaries

- **Multi-agent:** agents handing work along a pipeline; a human reviewing an agent's output; several agents claiming tasks from a shared queue.
- **Not multi-agent:** a single agent working alone, however many tools or sessions it uses. An agent handing work to its own next session is one actor across time, not two actors.
- **Its complement is not a trait yet.** Work that no second actor independently checks has obligations of its own, and no trait captures it. See the gap recorded in the charter.

## Axioms it brings into force

Generated from each axiom's `applies-to`, the field that decides binding.

| [A5](../axioms/A5-perceptual-parity.md) | Perceptual Parity | An agent is about to act on state it derived rather than state it was given |

An axiom binds a system that has *any one* of its traits, so each axiom above also binds systems that have none of this trait but one of its others.

## Why the obligation follows

Every boundary between actors is a place where meaning can be lost, work can be redone, and one actor's error becomes another's premise.\
The obligations this trait brings are all about what must survive a crossing.
