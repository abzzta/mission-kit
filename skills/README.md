# Skills - the how-you-do-it layer

## Vision

**North star.**\
Every capability an engineering agent invokes is built once, installed, and executed the same way each time, whether or not a [coordination substrate](../entities/E9-substrate.md) is running.\
A *capability* here is a procedure with inputs, steps and an output, run largely as written.

**What this set is, and is not.**\
It is the packaged, executable capabilities an agent invokes rather than reconstructs.\
It is not guidance a reader follows, which belongs in [methods](../methods/README.md), [rules](../rules/README.md) or [practices](../practices/README.md), nor a procedure a script could take whole, which is a [tool](../tools/README.md), nor a runbook for one system, which belongs with that system.

**Succeeding.**\
The set is measured on four dimensions, never collapsed into one score:

- **Built once** - each skill packages one capability that would otherwise be reconstructed by whoever needs it next.
- **Declared dependencies** - every dependency is an edge a script can check, and none lives only in prose.
- **Minimal judgement** - every step a script could take is left to a script.
- **Balance** - no kind of capability grows while another holds none, and none exists only for one coordination system.

**Authority.**\
The director holds this vision and ratifies any change to it, under [`M11`](../methods/M11-change-a-charter.md).

**What this vision does not authorise.**\
Citing this vision admits no skill and licenses no change of direction; a skill is admitted only by the tests under *What earns an entry*.

Operator-level capabilities and reusable tooling.\
A skill is *invoked*, not followed: it names a procedure with inputs, steps and an output, and it is expected to be executed largely as written.

The set exists so that a capability built once is installed and invoked rather than reconstructed by whoever needs it next, and executed the same way each time.

---

## Territory

**Scope.**\
This set covers **every capability an engineering agent invokes to do its work**, whether or not the coordination substrate is running.\
The claim is set by what the set is for, not by what it holds today.

**Growth policy.**\
Uncapped.\
A member is one executable, repeatable capability, invoked and run largely as written, at the grain of a procedure with inputs, steps and an output that would otherwise be reconstructed by whoever needs it next.\
Members are balanced on what the capability does, so that no family grows while whole kinds of capability hold none, and none exists only for one coordination system without a counterpart for work done without it.

---

## Operation

This set is analysed by [`M12`](../methods/M12-investigate-a-set.md) and changed by [`M11`](../methods/M11-change-a-charter.md).\
Its members are balanced on what the capability does, and an analysis also checks each family for a counterpart that serves work done without its coordination system.\
Dependencies between members are the `prerequisite` and `composes` edges declared in each body's frontmatter, so an analysis reads them from those edges and [`tools/skill-graph.mjs`](../tools/skill-graph.mjs), never from names or prose.\
A candidate that only describes is routed to methods, rules or practices, one a script could take whole to [tools](../tools/README.md), and a composition of capabilities into an operator role to [bundles](../bundles/README.md).

---

## What earns an entry

A capability earns one when it is executable, repeatable, and would otherwise be reconstructed from scratch by whoever needs it next.

A skill that only describes is a method, rule or practice filed in the wrong layer, as `M9` was before it moved.\
A skill invoked once, for one system, is a runbook and belongs with that system.\
A skill whose steps a script could take should be that script, per [`A11`](../axioms/A11-cognitive-minimalism.md), with the skill reduced to when to run it.

---

## Neighbours

| Neighbour | The question that separates them |
|---|---|
| [Methods](../methods/README.md) | Is it packaged to be installed and invoked, or held as guidance a reader follows? A method is the single source of a procedure's content; a skill packages a procedure and earns its packaging where scripts or assets make it necessary. |
| [Rules](../rules/README.md) and [practices](../practices/README.md) | Does it produce anything? Guidance that governs how work is done without producing anything is a rule or a practice, never a skill. |
| [Tools](../tools/README.md) | Could a script take every step? Then it is a tool, and a skill at most says when to run it. |
| [Bundles](../bundles/README.md) | Is it a capability, or a composition of capabilities into an operator role? Bundles hold deployment composition, take no ID and appear in no ledger. |
| [Work-types](../work-types/README.md) | Is it how a capability is executed, or a kind of work that can be claimed and closed? A work-type may be performed using a skill. |

---

## Member shape

**A skill is two files, on purpose.**\
Each skill is a directory holding a portable `SKILL.md`, with a `K*` stub beside it in this layer.

The stub is the catalogue entry.\
It carries the `id`, `status`, ledger title and hydration trigger, and it points at the body.

The body carries none of those.\
A catalogue placement is meaningless once the skill is lifted into another repository, and a skill that arrives carrying a foreign corpus's ID is unusable without editing.\
The split is what makes a skill portable and addressable at the same time, and it is why [`SC3`](../schemas/SC3-skill.md) governs the body's frontmatter separately from [`SC1`](../schemas/SC1-catalog-entry.md) governing the stub's.

---

## Composition

**Composition is expressed as edges, not as names.**\
A skill declares `prerequisite` for what must be read first, and `composes` for the primitives a specialist system is built from.

Depth is **derived** from those edges as the longest path from a root, and is never stored in a name.\
Encoding hierarchy into a name freezes it, and it rots on the first change to the graph.

[`tools/skill-graph.mjs`](../tools/skill-graph.mjs) makes the edges load-bearing rather than narrative: every target must resolve, the graph must be acyclic, each composed primitive's construct family must actually appear in the skill's assets, and every bundle's `skills` entry must name a real skill.

Skills compose into operator-facing roles through bundles.

---

## Faults

- **The stub without a body, or a body without a stub.** One is a citation resolving to nothing; the other is a capability nothing routes to.
- **The level in the name.** Hierarchy encoded into a filename, which freezes a graph that is expected to change.
- **The dependency in prose.** One skill relying on another without a declared edge, so the graph and the bundles disagree about what must be installed together.
- **The host-bound family.** A family of capabilities that exists only for one coordination system, with no counterpart for work done without it.
- **The crowded family.** One family growing while whole kinds of capability hold none, so the set reads as complete to anyone who only meets the crowded kind.
- **The skill that should be a tool.** A deterministic procedure written for a model to follow, spending judgement on work a script would do identically and cheaper.
