# Style - the how-you-say-it layer

## Purpose

**End state.**\
Every medium a reader meets - documents, messages to a human, commit messages and code - has its form held by rules, each stating one property of the finished artifact and none restating another.\
Every rule a predicate can express is held by exactly one tool, and every other rule is named as held by reading.\
The rules stay the delivery mechanism and never the payload, and no author fixes the same defect of form twice.

A **style rule** governs an artifact's form, and is judged by reading the output rather than by watching it being produced.

The set exists because form is part of what knowledge is.\
Under [`A4`](../axioms/A4-zero-loss-knowledge.md) knowledge is an engineering product, so a convention that keeps an artifact diffable, searchable and unambiguous is a functional requirement rather than a preference.\
Without the set, each author settles form afresh, and the same defect is fixed in one document and reintroduced in the next.

## Territory

**Scope.**\
This set covers **the form of every artifact a reader meets**: documents, messages to a human, commit messages, and code - its names and its comments.\
The claim is set by what the set is for, not by what it holds today.

**Growth policy.**\
Uncapped.\
A member is one convention about the form of one medium at one grain, judged in the finished artifact, earned by a real defect, and holding across artifacts.\
Members are balanced on non-overlap: one rule holds one decision on one surface, and an enforced rule names exactly one tool.\
Rules for media other than documents are grouped into sub-sets by medium once there is a second such rule, in any medium other than documents.

---

## What earns an entry

All three must hold.

1. **It governs form.** Placement is stated once, in [`M0`](../methods/README.md): axiom, procedure, style, rule, practice, asked in that order. A style rule is what reaches the third question - it produces nothing of its own, and it governs how the artifact reads whatever work produced it.
2. **Its absence produced a real defect** in a real artifact, and a reader can be shown the difference. Aesthetic preference does not qualify.
3. **It holds across artifacts**, not inside one document.

Prefer a rule a script can hold.\
If the rule can be stated as a predicate over the text, state it that way and write the tool, because a prose convention degrades to a matter of taste the first time two authors disagree.

## Neighbours

| Neighbour | The question that separates them |
|---|---|
| [Rules](../rules/README.md) | Does it govern the artifact's form, or what the work must do or record? A revival trigger on a deferred item is a rule, though it is visible in text. |
| [Practices](../practices/README.md) | Could the finished artifact show it was followed? If nothing in the output could, it is a practice. |
| [Methods](../methods/README.md) | Does it produce a result of its own? A method does; a style rule only shapes one. |
| [Schemas](../schemas/README.md) | Is it the shape of a field, which a validator holds, or how the field's content reads? `SC1` holds that `hydrate-when` exists; a style rule holds what it says. |
| [Skills](../skills/README.md) | Is it a capability applied while working, or a property judged in the result? |

---

## Composition

Rules at different grains apply to the same artifact at once and do not override each other; a file is conformant when every rule that reaches it holds.\
Within a grain, members divide one surface rather than compete for it.

- **A surface is divided by decision.** Where several rules reach one surface, each holds one decision about it, and none restates another's.
- **A concern spanning grains is split between them.** The coarser rule decides what the artifact must carry, and the finer rule decides how it is rendered.
- **Rules for one document type nest.** One rule may order a document and define a slot that another rule fills.
- **A rule may compose across layers**, as a member of a set spanning layers whose charter in [`sets/`](../sets/README.md) declares it.

---

## Enforcement boundary

A style rule is worth more when a script holds it, and the layer says openly which ones are held.\
The *Held by* column of the index is generated from each rule's `enforced-by`, so the split is declared once, in the member.

An enforced rule names exactly one tool, and [`tools/check-enforcers.sh`](../tools/check-enforcers.sh) verifies the pairing in both directions: a rule naming a tool that does not exist fails, and so does a per-rule tool no rule claims.\
One rule, one tool, and that tool owns both the check and the fix, so a rule cannot be reported by one implementation and refused by another.

The remaining rules need judgement and are reviewed by reading.\
That is a stated property of the layer, not a backlog: some conventions are about whether a sentence earns its place, and no script settles that.

Style is gated on changed files rather than on the whole corpus.\
The corpus carries debt that predates the checkers, so gating the diff blocks new debt and converts the rest opportunistically as sections are edited.

---

## Axiom alignment

The set serves `A4`: form that keeps knowledge searchable and diffable is part of not losing it.\
It falls short wherever a rule is held only by reading, because that rule's hold is as strong as the review that reads for it.\
It falls short further wherever a medium it claims carries knowledge with no rule for its form.

---

## Faults

- **The forked enforcer.** Two tools holding one rule, disagreeing at the edges. This is why a rule names exactly one.
- **The orphaned rule.** A convention nobody enforces and nobody reviews, which teaches readers that the layer is decorative.
- **The unscoped medium.** Rules for one medium scattered among the document rules with nothing grouping them. A second rule for a medium other than documents, in any such medium, is the point at which the medium rules earn sub-sets of their own.
- **The work rule in style clothing.** A convention filed here that governs what the work does or records rather than how the artifact reads, where an author applying rules will not look for it.
- **The corpus-wide sweep.** Converting all legacy debt in one commit, producing a diff no one can review and hiding a real change inside it.
