# Entities

## Purpose

**End state.**\
Every term the corpus leans on across layers, where two competent readers could act differently on the same sentence, resolves to one definition in one home.\
Each definition states what its term is and what it is not, is cited wherever the term carries weight, and leaves no load-bearing noun for a cold reader to reconstruct.\
No word carries two meanings, and no concept answers to two words.

What a thing **is**, never how it is done.

An entity entry fixes the meaning of one term that an engineering organisation cannot afford to leave imprecise.\
This entry is the layer's charter: it states what earns a definition and what shape one takes, and it defines no term itself.\
It is not an entity, which is why the entity body shape declared in [`SC6`](../schemas/SC6-entry-body.md) exempts it.

**Why the layer exists.**\
The corpus runs on terms it has never defined.\
Measured across the entries and skill bodies at the time this layer was created:

| Term | Files using it | Times defined |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gate` | 91 | 0 |
| `evidence` | 80 | 0 |
| `substrate` | 79 | 0 |
| `sovereign` | 30 | 0 |
| `seal` | 23 | 0 |
| `closeout` | 23 | 0 |
| `lease` | 18 | 0 |
| `arc` | 57 | 13, scattered |

`sovereign` titles three axioms and is defined in none of them.\
`arc` is the worse case: thirteen partial definitions in thirteen places is not a definition, it is drift that has already happened.

A cold agent is the corpus's stated reader, and it cannot instantiate an organisation whose load-bearing nouns resolve to nothing.\
That is the mandate failing on vocabulary rather than on content.

## Territory

**Scope.**\
This set covers **every term the corpus leans on across layers where two competent readers could act differently on the same sentence**.\
The claim is set by what the set is for, not by what it holds today.

**Growth policy.**\
Uncapped.\
A member is one term, defined at the grain of a single meaning, earned by what imprecision about it would cost rather than by how often it appears.\
Members are balanced on one home per term - no term defined here and in a charter or member, and no two entries for one concept - and on being cited, so that each definition is reached where its term carries weight.

---

## What earns an entry

A term earns one when imprecision about it would cost something real: a wrong gate, a mis-scoped claim, two people building to different meanings of the same word.\
Ubiquity alone does not qualify a term, and neither does jargon that only ever appears inside one skill.

The test is whether two competent readers could act differently on the same sentence.\
If they could, define it.

## Neighbours

| Neighbour | The question that separates them |
|---|---|
| A layer's own charter | Does the term name one layer's members, or is it leaned on across layers? A charter states what its members are; an entity for the same word is earned only by the two-readers test across layers, and then it fixes the word's meaning and cites the charter's admission rule rather than restating it. |
| [Schemas](../schemas/README.md) | Is it what a term means, or the machine-checkable shape of an instance? An entity fixes what a word means; a schema field such as [`SC1`](../schemas/SC1-catalog-entry.md)'s `category` carries the value one instance holds. |
| [Methods](../methods/README.md) and [skills](../skills/README.md) | Does it say what a thing is, or how to do something? A procedure belongs in a method, or a skill if it is executable. |
| [Traits](../traits/README.md) | Is it a term the corpus leans on, or a characteristic of a system that decides which axioms bind it? |
| [Artifacts](../artifacts/README.md) | Is it a term, or a document type a lifecycle produces? |

---

## Member shape

Fixed, so definitions can be compared and evaluated rather than merely read.\
The shape is declared in [`SC6`](../schemas/SC6-entry-body.md) and enforced by `tools/check-entry-body.sh`, so this list is a reading of the contract rather than a second copy of it.

- **Definition** - what it is, stated once, without mechanism.
- **Discriminators** - the tests that separate it from its near neighbours.
- **Boundaries** - what it explicitly is not.
- **Relations** - typed edges to other entities.
- **Why precision matters** - what breaks when it is conflated.

The `Boundaries` section is load-bearing rather than decorative.\
A definition that only says what a thing is leaves every adjacent case undecided, which is how one term becomes thirteen.

---

## Composition

Entities compose through the typed edges in each member's `Relations`, and form chains and terms that stand apart.

- **A chain** runs from a term to the one it is a kind of, or a part of; not every instance of the broader term is one of the narrower.
- **A term that stands apart** is ordered by a different relation, and a member a reader could confuse with it says so as a relation, *not to be read as*.
- Entities meet the rest of the corpus by citation, from the layers whose vocabulary they fix.

---

## Faults

- **The undefined noun.** A term load-bearing in dozens of documents and defined in none, so each reader reconstructs it slightly differently and no two reconstructions are compared.
- **The drifted synonym.** Two words for one concept, or one word for two, discovered only when a decision made under one reading is executed under the other.
- **The procedure filed as a definition.** An entry here that answers how instead of what; it belongs in methods or skills, and it hides the absence of a real definition.
- **The glossary nobody cites.** Definitions written once and referenced nowhere, so drift resumes immediately and the layer becomes decoration.
- **The double home.** A term defined both here and in a charter or member, free to disagree.
