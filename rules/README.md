# Rules - the how-you-must layer

## Purpose

**End state.**\
Every point in a unit of work where how it is done can be verified from its record is held by a rule that names its trace.\
Every trace is read - by a tool wherever one can check it, by review where none can - so no rule is held in name only.\
Guidance that could be held is never left merely urged.

A **rule** governs how work is done, produces nothing of its own, and **leaves a trace a check could test**: something in the record of the work shows whether it was kept.

The set exists because a rule that leaves a trace can be held, and one that does not can only be urged.\
Separating rules from practices tells a reader which guidance can be verified after the fact, and tells an author which guidance owes a check.

---

## Placement

Placement is stated once, in [`M0`](../methods/README.md), and applies here unchanged: axiom, procedure, style, rule, practice, asked in that order.\
A rule is what reaches the fourth question: it produces nothing of its own, does not govern an artifact's form, and leaves a trace in the record a check could test.

---

## Territory

**Scope.**\
This set covers **the points in a unit of work where how it is done can be verified afterwards from its record**.

**Growth policy.**\
Uncapped.\
A member is one constraint on how work is done, at the grain of a single trace in the record that shows whether it was kept.\
Members are balanced on their traces: each declares one that a tool or a reader can check, and guidance whose trace nothing could check is a practice, in [`practices/`](../practices/README.md).

---

## Member shape

A rule declares its `trace` in frontmatter: the observable in the record that shows it was kept or broken, required by the catalogue contract.\
It names an enforcer in `enforced-by` when a tool checks it, and `tools/check-enforcers.sh` holds that tool to existing; a rule with no tool yet is still a rule, and is checked by reading the trace.

---

## Boundaries and composition

- **Against style:** style governs the artifact's form; a rule governs what the work does or records. Both may be checked by a tool.
- **Against practices:** both govern conduct; a practice leaves nothing to check.
- **Against methods:** a method produces a result; a rule produces nothing and constrains how other work is done.
- **With methods:** a method's steps may be held by rules - a rule on deferral holds what any procedure records when it defers.

---

## Faults

- **The rule with no trace.** Guidance filed here that leaves nothing to check; it is a practice, and its presence teaches that rules are advisory.
- **The trace nobody reads.** A rule whose trace exists and is never checked, by tool or by review; it is held in name only.
- **The style rule in rule clothing.** A convention about an artifact's form filed here, where writers do not look for it.
- **The unguarded record.** A point where work's record could be lost or rewritten, and no rule says it may not.
